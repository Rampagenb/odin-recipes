    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul><li>2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water, or as needed</li></ul>

    <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol><li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to 
                make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
            <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time and place in hot oil to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until 
                golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
